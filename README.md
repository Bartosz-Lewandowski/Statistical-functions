#Statistical functions
## General info 
I made typical statistical tests from scratch in R. 
My program include tests like:
* Student T test
* ANOVA
* MANOVA
* Correlation
* Linear regression
Each folder include different statistic test. 
Statistial_function include all tests and is some kind of combination of all functions. It's "interactive" and depends of what kind of data inputed it gives different opitions to choose. 
## Instruction to Statistical_function
Welcome!
To use this function you have to entered variables as argument.
 y - numerical varible (this variable is required),
 y2 - second numerical variable,
 x - factorial variable,
 x2 - second factorial variable,
Next you choose what test you want to do.
To make T test you must enter at least y. If you want to make t test for two variables, you must enter y, and y2.
To make linear regression you must enrer y, and second variable. Dependent variable is y.
To make correlation you must enter y, and y2.
To make anova test you must enter y, x or x2, depending on which (one-way or two-way) test you want to make.
No matter how many variables you entered it will take only y,y2,x and x2 to tests, only linear regression will take every variable inputed.
